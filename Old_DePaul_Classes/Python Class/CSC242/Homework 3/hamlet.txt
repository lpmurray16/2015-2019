to be or not to be that is the question
whether tis nobler in the mind to suffer
the slings and arrows of outrageous fortune
or to take arms against a sea of troubles
and by opposing end them to die to sleep
no more and by a sleep to say we end
the heartache and the thousand natural shocks
that flesh is heir to tis a consummation
devoutly to be wished to die to sleep
to sleep, perchance to dream ay there is the rub
for in that sleep of death what dreams may come
when we have shuffled off this mortal coil
must give us pause there is the respect
that makes calamity of so long life
