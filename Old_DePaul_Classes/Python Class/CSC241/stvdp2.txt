In 1605, Vincent sailed from Marseilles on his way back from Castres where he had 
gone to sell some property he had received in an inheritance from a wealthy patron 
in Toulouse, and was taken captive by Barbary pirates, who brought him to Tunis.
 De Paul was auctioned off as a slave to the highest bidder, and spent two years in 
bondage.

His first master was a fisherman, but Vincent was unsuitable for this line of work 
due to sea-sickness and was soon sold. His next master was a spagyrical physician, 
alchemist and inventor. He became fascinated by his arts and was taught how to 
prepare and administer his master's spagyric remedies.
