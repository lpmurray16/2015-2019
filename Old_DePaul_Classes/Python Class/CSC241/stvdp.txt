Vincent was born in 1581 in the village of Pouy in Gascony, in the Province of 
Guyenne and Gascony, the Kingdom of France, to peasant farmers, father Jean and 
mother Bertrande de Moras de Paul. There was in the vicinity, a stream named the 
"Paul" and it is believed that this might have been the derivation of the family name.
 He wrote the name as one word – Depaul, possibly to avoid the inference that he was 
of noble birth, but none of his correspondents did so. He had three brothers – 
Jean, Bernard and Gayon, and two sisters – Marie and Marie-Claudine. He was the third 
child. At an early age, he showed a talent for reading and writing but during his 
childhood, his work was as a herder of his family's livestock. At 15, his 
father sent him to seminary, managing to pay for it by selling the family’s oxen.
